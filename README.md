Problem statements for the project ( Mid-Term Group Project: NewsBot Intelligence System ): With so many news articles published every day, users struggle to filter information, detect trends, and quickly understand what’s happening. The NewsBot Intelligence System was created to solve this by automatically processing news data, identifying key topics, clustering related stories, analyzing sentiment, and allowing users to explore insights through a conversational AI interface. It transforms large amounts of raw text into clear, actionable information.

Approach & Methodology: The project followed a full AI workflow: collecting and cleaning news articles, preprocessing text with NLP techniques, and applying clustering and topic modeling to group related stories. I then used sentiment analysis and additional analytics to extract deeper insights. Finally, I built a conversational interface that lets users interact with the system, ask questions, and explore news trends in a natural and intuitive way.

Results & Evaluation: The system successfully processed large sets of news articles and produced clear topic clusters, trend insights, and sentiment summaries. The clustering models grouped related stories with good coherence, and the NLP pipeline delivered accurate preprocessing and analysis. User testing with the conversational interface showed that the chatbot made it easier to explore news data and understand key patterns. Overall, the system provided reliable, interpretable results and demonstrated the value of combining NLP, clustering, and conversational AI in news analysis.

Learning Outcomes: Through this project, I strengthened my skills in data pipeline design, NLP preprocessing, clustering, and sentiment analysis. I gained experience integrating multiple AI components into a single system and learned how to present insights through a conversational interface. The project also improved my teamwork, documentation, and ability to turn theoretical concepts into practical, working solutions.

This project was built using Python and standard AI/NLP libraries. The main dependencies include: Python 3.9+, pandas – for data loading and preprocessing, langdetect — for language identification, Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab – for experimentation and development, scikit-learn – for clustering (K-Means, TF-IDF, etc.) and evaluation.
