Problem Statement for the project (Final Project: NewsBot Intelligence System 2.0): The ever-growing volume of news articles makes it increasingly difficult for users to keep track of key events, emerging trends, and reliable information. While traditional news platforms provide raw content, they often lack intelligent summarization, trend analysis, or interactive exploration features. The NewsBot Intelligence System 2.0 addresses this challenge by enhancing the original system with more advanced NLP processing, improved clustering and topic modeling, richer sentiment and trend analysis, and an upgraded conversational interface. Its goal is to help users efficiently navigate and interpret news data, transforming large volumes of unstructured text into actionable insights in an intuitive and interactive way.

Approach & Methodology: The project extended the original NewsBot workflow with improved AI techniques. I collected and preprocessed news data, applied advanced NLP methods for text cleaning and embedding, and used enhanced clustering and topic modeling to group related articles. Sentiment and trend analyses provided deeper insights, while the upgraded conversational interface allowed users to interact naturally with the system, explore topics, and obtain summaries quickly and intuitively.

Results & Evaluation: The upgraded system successfully processed larger news datasets and produced more coherent topic clusters and trend insights than the original version. Sentiment and trend analyses accurately highlighted emerging topics and user-relevant patterns. User testing with the improved conversational interface showed faster and more intuitive exploration of news data, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining advanced NLP, clustering, and interactive AI for actionable news insights.

Learning Outcomes: Through this project, I enhanced my skills in advanced NLP, clustering, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis. I gained experience integrating multiple AI components into a cohesive system and improving the user experience through a conversational interface. The project also strengthened my abilities in teamwork, problem-solving, and translating theoretical concepts into practical, real-world AI solutions.

This project was built using Python and standard AI/NLP libraries. The main dependencies include: 
Python 3.9+
pandas – data loading and preprocessing
transformers (HuggingFace) – embeddings, sentiment analysis, or topic modeling
gensim – advanced topic modeling (LDA)
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab – development and testing
KMeans

Instructions to Access:
Download your chosen dataset (CSV, JSON, or RSS feed).
Place the file in the data/ folder.
Update file paths in the code if necessary (e.g., data/sample_news_2.0.csv).
Run preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
